> There are some websites help push up your coding skills
1. [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
- It is a technology hiring platform that is the standard for assessing developer skills
2. [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com)
- It offers a collection of programming challenges in Javascript. I recommend going through the easy and medium challenges.
3. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
- LeetCode OJ is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews.What I like about leetcode, it assumes zero knowledge of JS and you can work at your own pace in learning JS algorithms
4. [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com)
- It is a great way to learn JS alogorithm basics. My favorite part is completing a solution and comparing your answer to the many other answers people have submitted.
5. [Projecteuler](http://projecteuler.net)
- For those of you who enjoy Mathematics toy problemes. It starts from basics, all the way to abstract math. The easy ones are good one to start at.
